# Code for Good: Accelerated Cure Project: Data Visualization 
We analyzed trends among the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the the different variations of MS. 
We used Pandas to analyze the data and D3.js to create a radar chart which we believed would be most representative of the difference in the data.

# Deployment
In order to deploy the data, one must cd into 'visualization', the directory which contains app.js. 
From there, the scripts are ready to be loaded to the server.
```
cd visualizaton
python -m http.server
```
# Built With
D3.js- a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers
